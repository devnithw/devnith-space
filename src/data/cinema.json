In my first watch I hated Summer for what she did. This was as I enetered my 20's and going through a similar situationship. As I grew older I learened better interpretations of the movie. According to reviews online, there are three most popular; Romanticism (Sympathizing with Tom), Cynicism (Sympathizing with Summer) and Compatability (Sympathizing with both).  Worth watching again and again to learn more about life."
