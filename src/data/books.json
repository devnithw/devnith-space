        "review": "One of the best books form my favourite author [[highlight: Hermann Hesse]] which explores intelligence and search for wisdom. I began this book thinking it's the story of the Buddha, but it's an alternative story of another man named Siddartha. The Buddha appears in the story and I found that cameo very cinematic. I like how this book challenges the teachings of Buddha in a very constructive way. And I liked how it made me question deeper, as opposed to what is taught in Buddhism as a reliogion, where speculation is a sin. This builds on top of how Buddha approached Buddhism as a lifestyle and a philosophy instead of a religion."

I like the simple examples and analogies it uses to teach good financial principles. Recommended starting point for anyone looking to manage personal finances better."

        "review": "Reading this book was so much better than watching the Netflix series. Sad that they have removed most of the science stuff and dumbed it down for general people to understand. The book covers more theoretical foundation and history of the Trisolarians. My favourite scene from the book is where the sophons are unravelled into larger dimensional space, in which the experiments go wrong and a large eye in the sky nearly destroys the trisolarians."

These types of themes open up many views about the world and different interpretations so I believe it's important to read them."
