        "review": "One of the best books form my favourite author [[highlight: Hermann Hesse]] which explores intelligence and search for wisdom. I began this book thinking it's the story of the Buddha, but it's an alternative story of another man named Siddartha. The Buddha appears in the story and I found that cameo very cinematic. I like how this book challenges the teachings of Buddha in a very constructive way. And I liked how it made me question deeper, as opposed to what is taught in Buddhism as a reliogion, where speculation is a sin. This builds on top of how Buddha approached Buddhism as a lifestyle and a philosophy instead of a religion."

I like the simple examples and analogies it uses to teach good financial principles. Recommended starting point for anyone looking to manage personal finances better."
