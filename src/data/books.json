        "review": "One of the best books form my favourite author [[highlight: Hermann Hesse]] which explores intelligence and search for wisdom. I began this book thinking it's the story of the Buddha, but it's an alternative story of another man named Siddartha. The Buddha appears in the story and I found that cameo very cinematic. I like how this book challenges the teachings of Buddha in a very constructive way. And I liked how it made me question deeper, as opposed to what is taught in Buddhism as a reliogion, where speculation is a sin. This builds on top of how Buddha approached Buddhism as a lifestyle and a philosophy instead of a religion."

The book covers more theoretical foundation and history of the Trisolarians. My favourite scene from the book is where the sophons are unravelled into larger dimensional space, in which the experiments go wrong and a large eye in the sky nearly destroys the trisolarians."

Yes, it does beat around the bush and repeat the same simple idea as in most non-fiction books. But this really helped me to get organized and built a system for collecting information. It was helpful to make my notion database. The second brain as a concept is an idea everyone should learn (Although I switched from second brain to Zettlekasten, and switched from Notion to Obsidian). In the end, its all about organization no matter what note taking app you use. "
